    <p class="grayItalic">        
I won't admit that I was wrong<br>
I won't admit that I was right<br>
It's a dream, it's a dream you're living in<br>
It's a dream, it's a dream you're dying in<br>
I wanted to something but here I am with you<br>
I'm happy with you<br>
Happy with you<br>
You got the brightest eyes I've ever seen<br>
You got the brightest eyes I've ever seen<br>
All inside, the sun, your eyes, All as one<br>
High times<br>
Against the tide<br>
Against the tide<br>
Oh Against the tide<br>
